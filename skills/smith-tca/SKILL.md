# Smith TCA - Swift Composable Architecture

## Core Knowledge Base

For comprehensive guidance on TCA patterns, modern best practices, and architecture:

- **TCA Patterns & Guidelines**: [knowledge/AGENTS-TCA-PATTERNS.md](knowledge/AGENTS-TCA-PATTERNS.md)
- **Decision Trees**: [knowledge/AGENTS-DECISION-TREES.md](knowledge/AGENTS-DECISION-TREES.md)
- **Universal Patterns**: [knowledge/AGENTS-AGNOSTIC.md](knowledge/AGENTS-AGNOSTIC.md)

## Quick Navigation

When asked about TCA reducers, state management, navigation, or testing:

1. **Use Glob** to find relevant files: `Glob("knowledge/**/*.md")`
2. **Use Grep** to search content: `Grep("@Shared", "knowledge/")`
3. **Use Read** to access files: `Read("knowledge/AGENTS-TCA-PATTERNS.md")`

All knowledge is in the `knowledge/` directory - search there for answers.

## Skill Domains

**smith-tca** handles:
- ✅ TCA patterns (1.23.0+ modern syntax)
- ✅ @Reducer macro and @ObservableState
- ✅ @Shared state management and discipline
- ✅ TCA navigation (.sheet, .scope, complex navigation)
- ✅ TCA testing with Swift Testing
- ✅ @Bindable store binding patterns
- ✅ Feature composition and reducer extraction
- ✅ Deprecated API migration (WithViewStore, etc.)

**For general Swift patterns**, use the **smith-core** skill.
**For platform-specific patterns**, use the **smith-platforms** skill.
